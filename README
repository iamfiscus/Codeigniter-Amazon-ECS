Hey everybody,

This is a Codeigniter library where you can search the Amazon Product API.
Also you can put an affiliate ID in so that all returning results will give
you a customized affiliate referral url.

DOCUMENTATION:
Amazon ECS Documentation is located at http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/

INSTALLATION:
Just copy the files from this package to the corresponding folder in your 
application folder.  For example, copy AmazonECS/config/amazon_ecs.php to 
system/application/config/amazon_ecs.php. 

Obtaining API Keys:
- AWS Developer
